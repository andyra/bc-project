<h1 class="page__title">Default Items</h1>

<p>
  Moving/copying items that can't be nested inside other objects (events, checkins, cards, to-do lists, etc.) is fairly straightforward—we just need people to tell us what project they want to move/copy to and that's it!
</p>

<div class="callout">
  <strong>Tip</strong>: All the prototypes in this project use the same entry point: click the Menu button in the right corner, then "Copy to…".
</div>

{% include menu.html %}
