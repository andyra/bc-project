<h1 class="page__title">Default Items</h1>

<p>
  Moving/copying items that can't be nested inside other objects (Event/Checkin/Card/To-Do List/etc.) is fairly straightforward—we just need people to tell us what project they want to move/copy to and that's it!
</p>
<p>IMO, this is where the Menu version works best.</p>

{% include menu.html %}
