<h1>Andy's Take-Home Project</h1>

<div class="py-lg text-lg">
  <p>
    Here are a couple ideas that could make moving/copying feel snappier
    in Basecamp. I think there are basically two main problems to address:
  </p>
  <ul class="list list--decimal">
    <li>
      <strong>Can we stay in context?</strong>: As mentioned in the
      project brief, the current version requires a new page load. That
      feels a bit disruptive, but luckily there are a few ways to handle
      in-context workflows!
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Can we reduce the number of clicks?</strong>: The current
      version uses select fields for choosing projects, folders, to-do
      lists, etc. This isn't so bad if you've just got one or two levels
      of hierarchy to work with, but gets cumbersome beyond that.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p class="callout">
    Note: I used "Copy" for the language throughout the prototypes to keep
    things simple. So don't be too confused if you click "Move" and the UI
    says "Copy"!
  </p>
</div>

<hr />

<div class="py-lg">
  <h2 class="m-0">Modal</h2>
  <p class="text-lg">
    Modals allow you to stay in context of the existing page and provide
    enough real estate to handle whatever UI we decide to go with.
  </p>
  <p class="text-lg">
    I'd say this is middle ground between the current version and the Menu
    version below in terms of perceived speediness.
  </p>
  <ul class="space-y-sm">
    <li>
      <a class="button button--positive" href="modal-minimal">
        Modal with minimal UI changes
      </a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a class="button button--positive" href="modal-folder-nav">
        Modal with folder nav
      </a>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="py-lg">
  <h2 class="m-0">Menu</h2>
  <p class="text-lg">
    This version leverages the existing menu to let people select a
    destination for the item they're moving/copying. There are a couple
    different prototypes to showcase how various types of objects could be
    handled.
  </p>
  <p class="text-lg">
    It optimizes for keeping you in context at the expense of space; it's
    compact, so there's not a lot of wiggle room for extra content,
    explainer text, previews, etc.
  </p>
  <ul class="space-y-sm">
    <li>
      <a class="button button--positive" href="menu-default">
        Menu: default items
      </a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a class="button button--positive" href="menu-lists">
        Menu: to-dos
      </a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a class="button button--positive" href="menu-docs">
        Menu: docs & files

  <h2>Other Notes</h2>
  <ul class="list list--decimal text-lg">
    <li>
      <div class="font--demi">
        How does the solution work when you want to move several things in
        succession?
      </div>
      <p>
        The Modal version feels a little more like you're entering a new
        workflow than the Menu version, which feels less formal. Because
        of that, I think moving multiple items in succession via the menu
        would be a little less fatiguing.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div class="font--demi">
        Should comments be included when copying?
      </div>
      <p>
        No. At least, probably not? Having multiple versions of the same
        comment thread sounds like it would be confusing for people. If I
        add a comment on the original object's comment thread, does it
        carry over to the copied version, or are these now completely
        independent threads? Where's the best place to respond? What if
        there were 8 copies of an item—surely 8 copies of the conversation
        wouldn't be useful?
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, the comments might be specific to a certain project,
        with certain members, etc. Those comments might not be relevant
        when moved to a different project context.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm sure there are some good use cases for copying comments, but
        it's a lot easier to think of the potential weirdness it might
        cause!

        Is it essential to see the other items in a folder or on a to-do
        list when moving items into them?
      </div>
      <p>
        Hmm, good question! I wouldn't say it was <em>essential</em>,
        exactly, although I could see it coming in handy from time to
        time. Some thoughts:
      </p>
      <ul class="list list--disc">
        <li>
          My guess is that most people have a destination in their head
          when they decide to move an item (e.g. "I need to move this
          to-do to the Pre-release Checklist"). If that's the case, they
          already know where they're moving it to.
        </li>
        <li>
          A content preview is probably most useful when you're not very
          familiar with the to-do list/folder that you're copying
          something to. I haven't used Basecamp in a large company setting
          before, so I'm curious how often that comes up in peoples'
          day-to-day experience. Are people often like "Wait,
          <em>what</em> folder is this again?"
        </li>
        <li>
          Quite a bit of UI real-estate is needed to show previews. While
          not a problem in itself, it's probably a trade-off between
          showing previews and making something feel lightweight.
        </li>
        <li>
          My guess (take that for what it's worth!) is that content
          previews come in handy upon occasion, but aren't all that useful
          for the majority of interactions. If that's the case, showing
          previews by default actually forces people to hunt for the thing
          they <em>really</em> want, which is the title.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div class="font--demi">
        What if you have dozens or hundreds of destinations (projects,
        folders, lists) for a move or copy?
      </div>
      <p>
        There are a couple strategies that come to mind to sort through
        large volumes of data:
      </p>
      <ul class="list list--disc">
        <li>
          <strong>Search</strong>: instead of forcing people to scroll
          through a lot of options, provide a way for them to type a few
          characters to narrow the list. A
          <a
            href="https://codepen.io/andyra-the-typescripter/pen/yLxMzZx"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            >combobox field</a
          >, for example, is snappier than scrolling through select
          options, but still allows you to scroll through content if
          you're so inclined.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Provide suggestions</strong>: You could try to be smart
          about what people are trying to get to: show recently or
          frequently accessed items at the top. The danger here, of
          course, is that you will have guessed wrong and the person on
          the other end of the screen has to find their own way.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Consider updating the language</strong>
      <p>
        It's a minor point, but "Copy" usually means the first half of
        "Copy & Paste"—copy something, navigate where you want, then paste
        it there. In this context, it might be more clear to use slightly
        different language like "Copy to…", which suggests that this isn't
        your grandma's passive "copy to clipboard" operation.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
