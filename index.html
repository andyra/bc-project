<h1>Andy's at-home exercise</h1>

<div class="home-section">
  <p>
    Here are a couple ideas that could make moving/copying feel snappier in
    Basecamp. I think there are basically two main problems to address:
  </p>
  <ul class="list list--decimal">
    <li>
      <strong>Can we stay in context?</strong>
      <br />
      As mentioned in the project brief, the current version requires a couple page
      loads. That's a bit disruptive, but luckily there are a few ways to
      handle in-context workflows!
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Can we reduce the number of clicks?</strong>
      <br />
      The current version uses select fields for choosing projects, folders,
      to-do lists, etc. This isn't so bad if you've just got one or two levels
      of hierarchy to work with, but gets cumbersome beyond that.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>I've outlined a couple possible solutions below, each with their trade-offs.</p>
</div>

<div class="home-section">
  <h2 class="home-section__heading">Menu</h2>
  <p>
    This version leverages the existing menu to let people select a destination
    for the item they're moving/copying.
  </p>
  <p>
    It's compact and "right there," but the trade-off is that there's not a lot
    of wiggle room for extra content, explainer text, previews, etc. This would
    be a good option if we want to optimize for a light touch and didn't mind
    those limitations.
  </p>
  <p>Another side-benefit here is that this would translate well to mobile.</p>
  <p>
    There are a couple different prototypes to showcase how various types of
    objects could be handled:
  </p>
  <ul class="list list--decimal space-y-2">
    <li>
      <a class="button button--positive button--lg" href="menu-default">Menu: default items</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a class="button button--positive button--lg" href="menu-lists">Menu: to-do items</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a class="button button--positive button--lg" href="menu-docs">Menu: docs & files</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="home-section">
  <h2 class="home-section__heading">Modal</h2>
  <p>
    Modals allow you to stay in context of the existing page while providing
    enough real estate to handle whatever UI we decide to go with. I'd say this
    is middle ground between the current version and the Menu version in terms
    of perceived speediness.
  </p>
  <p>
    This would be a good option if our appetite was smaller, or if previews are
    decided to be an essential piece (more on preview below, by the by).
  </p>
  <ul class="list list--decimal space-y-2">
    <li>
      <a class="button button--positive button--lg" href="modal-minimal">Modal with minimal UI changes</a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a class="button button--positive button--lg" href="modal-folder-nav">Modal with folder nav</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="home-section">
  <h2 class="home-section__heading">Other Notes</h2>
  <ul class="list list--decimal">
    <li>
      <div class="font-semibold">
        How does the solution work when you want to move several things in
        succession?
      </div>
      <p>
        The Modal version feels a little more like you're entering a new
        workflow than the Menu version, which feels less formal. Because of
        that, I think moving multiple items in succession via the menu would be
        a little less fatiguing.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div class="font-semibold">Should comments be included when copying?</div>
      <p>
        No. At least, probably not? Having multiple versions of the same comment
        thread sounds like it would be confusing. If I add a comment on the
        original object's thread, does it carry over to the copied version, or
        are these now completely independent? Where's the best place to respond?
        Would it be weird to have 8 copies of a conversation if I copied
        something 8 times?
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not very familiar with how permissions work in Basecamp, but it
        could get tricky if you're copying a conversation to a project with
        completely different members. The context is different, so I'm not
        confident it would make sense to duplicate conversations.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm sure there are some good use cases for copying comments, but it's a
        lot easier to think of the complexities involved and the potential
        confusion it might cause!
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div class="font-semibold">
        Is it essential to see the other items in a folder or on a to-do list
        when moving items into them?
      </div>
      <p>
        Hmm, good question! I wouldn't say it was <em>essential</em>, exactly,
        although I could see it coming in handy from time to time. Some
        thoughts:
      </p>
      <ul class="list list--disc space-y-2">
        <li>
          My guess is that most people have a destination in their head when
          they decide to move an item (e.g. "I need to move this to-do to the
          Pre-release Checklist"). If that's the case, they already know where
          they're moving it to.
        </li>
        <li>
          A content preview is probably most useful when you're not familiar
          with the to-do list/folder that you're copying something to. I haven't
          used Basecamp in a large company setting before, so I'm curious how
          often that comes up in peoples' day-to-day experience. Are people
          often like "Wait,
          <em>what</em> folder is this again?"
        </li>
        <li>
          Quite a bit of UI real-estate is needed to show previews. While not a
          problem in itself, it's probably a trade-off between showing previews
          and making something feel lightweight.
        </li>
        <li>
          My hunch is that content previews come in handy upon occasion, but
          aren't essential for the majority of interactions. If that's the case,
          showing previews by default actually slows things down by adding more
          content on the screen people have to sift through.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <div class="font-semibold">
        What if you have dozens or hundreds of destinations (projects, folders,
        lists) for a move or copy?
      </div>
      <p>
        There are a couple strategies that come to mind to sort through large
        volumes of data:
      </p>
      <ul class="list list--disc">
        <li>
          <strong>Search</strong>: instead of forcing people to scroll through a
          lot of options, provide a way for them to type a few characters to
          narrow the list.
          <div class="my-4">
            <div class="menu menu--static">
              <div class="menu__section">

          <strong>Provide suggestions</strong>: You could try to be smart about
          what people are trying to get to: show recently or frequently accessed
          items at the top. The danger here, of course, is that you will have
          guessed wrong and the person on the other end of the screen has to
          find their own way.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Consider updating the language</strong>
      <p>
        It's a minor point, but "Copy" usually means the first half of "Copy &
        Paste"—copy something, navigate where you want, then paste it there. In
        this context, it might be more clear to use slightly different language
        like "Copy to…", which suggests that this isn't your grandma's passive
        "copy to clipboard" operation.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
